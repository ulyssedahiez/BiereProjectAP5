# ISEN Conception Orient√©e Objet - TP Starter

Here is the starter project to start working.

## Steps to getting started

Assure you installed latest version of NodeJS (v20 at this time). Please don't use the NodeJS package that comes with your OS package manager, use [NVM tool](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

On your favorite IDE (which VScode obviously), please install those plugins:

- Prettier
- ESLint

And assure you have this minimum settings:

```json
{
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll": true
  },
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.tabSize": 2,
  "[javascript]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
  }
  "[typescript]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
  }
}
```

You're now up to run !

Now install your dependencies by running `npm install` or `npm i` and run your project with `npm start`
